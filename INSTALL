Make sure that you read the README file first.

1. Run ./configure or ./configure --enable-xemacs

The --enable-xemacs flag ensures that the elisp files are compiled using
xemacs. Use this option if you use xemacs.

The configure program is provided in the source (do not run your own
configure). If you want to specify the directory in which recordsadmin should
be installed, you could say something like

./configure --prefix $HOME

Make sure ${bindir} (generally ${prefix}/bin) in the Makefile exists and is
writable by you.

2. Run make install (or just make)
After the lisp files have been compiled, this procedure is interactive and asks
for user defaults. Note: The lisp files are not installed anywhere.

3. The changes to your system that "make install" does are the following:

   a) Adds ~/.emacs-records (if this file already exists, it converts only
      specific parts of the file).

   b) Adds a couple of lines to ~/.emacs

   c) Adds recordsadmin to ${bindir}

   d) Creates your records directory (~/records or whatever you have specified
      during make) and adds some indexes there. If this directory already
      exists, then it reindexes your records and converts them to the new
      format. If you don't trust the conversion, I would really suggest that
      you KEEP A COPY OF YOUR RECORDS BEFORE DOING THE CONVERSION. Check the
      conversion by hand to make sure that the conversion is fine. Specially
      look for the following: HAVE EMBEDDED LINKS IN YOUR RECORDS BEEN
      CONVERTED CORRECTLY. Please tell me if this conversion is not okay.

4. Copy the next set of lines from 
";;;; records-mode" to 
";;;; records-mode end" into your ~/.emacs. Make sure that these lines occur
after the following line (which has been automatically added during install) in
your .emacs
(load "~/.emacs-records")
I did not automate this process since users may wish to change the key
settings. Users will probably use the records-goto-today function most
often. Bind it to a simple key.

;;;; records-mode
; Define key bindings for functions called from outside records mode

; The preferred binding for records-goto-today - uncomment to use it
(define-key global-map [?\C-c ?n] 'records-goto-today)
(define-key global-map [?\C-c ?-] 'records-underline-line)

; The Ctrl-x n map
(define-key global-map [?\C-x ?n ?t] 'records-goto-today)
(define-key global-map [?\C-x ?n ?r] 'records-insert-record-region)
(define-key global-map [?\C-x ?n ?b] 'records-insert-record-buffer)
(define-key global-map [?\C-x ?n ?f] 'records-insert-file-link)

; Hook up to the calendar mode
(add-hook 'calendar-load-hook 
	  (function
	   (lambda ()
	     (define-key calendar-mode-map "n" 'records-calendar-to-record))))

;;;*** OPTIONAL ***;;;

; If you like abbrev mode 
(add-hook 'records-mode-hooks
    (function
     (lambda ()
       (abbrev-mode 1))))

; If you want to be brought to today's record on startup
(records-goto-today)

;;;; records-mode end

5. Restart your emacs (unless you know how to evaluate regions in a buffer - in
which case get the key bindings and load in .emacs-records).

After restarting emacs, go back to the README file for using records mode in
emacs.
