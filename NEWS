Version 1.4.6
        Fixed a Y2K bug when years were specified in 2 digits!
        Added functionality so that records of the same subject can be 
          searched across records files. Thanks to Kaarthik Sivakumar.
        Fixed fontification bug for emacs so that the first character after
          the record subject is not read-only. This fixes an
          encryption/decryption bug in emacs also.

Version 1.4.5
        configure now takes an argument so that xemacs can be specified
          for byte compiling the elisp files.
        recordsadmin now updates the load path in ~/.emacs-records even 
          when the user specifies that the init file variables should not be
          updated. This is needed otherwise the load path becomes inconsistent 
          with the new installation. The init file variables are ofcourse not
          updated.

Version 1.4.4
        Fixed small bugs in TODO processing
        Files are saved after TODO processing, records insertion and 
          deletion if they were not modified previously.
        Empty record files are deleted after TODO processing and 
          deletion of records.
        Added records-move-record that will allow moving a record to 
          another date. 
        Added records-insert-file-link for inserting the current file
          as a link into today's record file.

Version 1.4
        New function records-create-todo for creating new todos.
        The default values of records-todo-begin-move-regexp, 
        records-todo-begin-copy-regexp and records-todo-end-regexp 
        has been changed and made more sane.
        The info file has minor updates.
        Added the NEWS file!

Version 1.3
        Records now has an info file available.
        Bug fixes in encryption and decryption of records.
