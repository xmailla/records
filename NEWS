* Changes in 1.5
** Administrativia

*** New maintainer. Xavier Maillard <xma@gnu.org> has taken over the
    maintainer ship. Thanks go to all of you who participated to the
    records developement till now. List of contributors is still in the
    AUTHORS file.

*** This is the first version released under GPL3+

*** Project hosting url has changed. The project is now hosted onto
    launchpad.net site at:

        http://launchpad.net/~emacs+records/records

        Bug reports, questions, etc are to be filled there.

** Build and installation

*** Better use of the autotools to ease package maintainance. Beginning
    with the v1.5.0 release, records.el has been cleaned up to more
    effectively make use of autoconf and automake. It should now be much
    easier to install. See the FAQ for hints on maintaining the package
    now.

*** Try to follow GNU standards as much as possiblee. Thus, starting
    with 1.5.1, records build system has dropped all exotic things and
    hacks.

*** Emacs lisp files are compiled using a modified automake `elisp-comp'
    script.

*** User can now choose an Emacs flavor by specifying --with-emacs or
    --with-xemacs.

*** Byte-compiling the lisp sources is now totally silent.
 
*** Internal copy of Mailcrypt has been removed. `configure' has been
    modified in order to choose the best mailcrypt distribution or let
    the user choose where it is installed.

     ./configure --with-mailcrypt=/tmp/mailcrypt

** Macros

*** all macros are now centralized into records-macro.el file. If a
    module needs a macro at compilation time, you _must_ do as follow:

       (eval-when-compile (require 'records-macro))

*** macros are now using the new backquote style syntax thus removing
    automatically compatibility for emacsen < 19.34 (or so). See section
    below.

** Compatibility

*** No effort will be made to support old emacsen (< 20.x). If it works
    for you, that's okay, if not, report back and try to include a
    patch.

** Miscelleanous

*** proposal/ has been bailed out. proposal is meant to be the next
    generation for records. It is tracked in a separate Bazaar branch.
    Proposal needs to be synced with latest stable release of records.
    Testing is not harder than doing:

       bzr branch lp:records.exp

** List of fixed bugs
   See above for ways to report bugs to us.
