This directory tree holds version 1.5.1 of records, an online diary
creator for GNU Emacs.

* Description

This is records 1.5.1, an Emacs mode which allows creation of an
online diary (see the file NEWS for information on new features and
other user-visible changes in recent versions of records).

Users can create records in their diary for different subjects
each day. Records provides linking and indexing facilities so that users
can easily collect their thoughts on a subject over a period of
time. For instance, it is easy to find out whether you were thinking of
quitting school two months back! Records provides a reminder service by
collecting your list of 'to do' things. A simple integration with the
Emacs calendar is also available.

* Dependencies
** GNU Emacs

records.el is supposed to work on various Emacs flavors starting at
20.x release. It has been tested also with latest developement version
(23.x).

** XEmacs

records.el is known to work with Xemacs 21.x or newer. For older
versions, please tell us how it goes.

** Mailcrypt

records will use the MAILCRYPT library to crypt sensible records
(either full records files or part of it).

* Installation

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to build and install
records on various systems, once you have unpacked or checked out the
entire Emacs file tree.

For a quickstart, these commands may be enough:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

* Special notes for GNU Bazaar version

If you are running records from GNU Bazaar, you may need to
(re)generate the `configure' file and all its accompanying files.
Doing so is no more than using our bootstrap script:
    
    ./bootstrap

For this to work, you must have the GNU autotools installed (autoconf
and automake)

* Quickstart

Make sure records is installed (or at least in your `load-path') and
type key "Ctrl-c n" (for records-goto-today). This will get you
today's records file. If you are starting fresh, it will be empty.

To insert a records subject type "Ctrl-c Ctrl-i" or look for "Insert
Record" in the menu. Once you have added a subject, you can start
typing ... Regarding spaces in subject titles, look at the FAQ.

Multiple subjects can be added in each day's records file. Infact the
same subject can be added multiple times in each day's records file.

For all the other functionality, look at the records menu. The menu
has been divided so that most of the functionality at the top of the
menu is related to records traversal (up, down, prev, next, goto etc).
The middle section adds, deletes and renames records. The last section
does administration tasks such as encryption, concatanation of records
by subject or days etc. Make sure you look at the records TODO
facility.

Remember that if you have just one records file (today's) then records
traversal's are not very useful!

The program recordsadmin has been provided in order to do meta-level
things - initialize (or reinitialize) your records software, change
date format, change directory structure and recreate records indexes
if they are broken (for example if your system crashes while emacs is
updating your indexes on the fly). You should not need to use it in
normal records use.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to build and install
records on various systems, once you have unpacked or checked out the
entire Emacs file tree.

More informations are available in the records info manual.
